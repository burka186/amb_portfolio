			<p>I know how to swim, but ever since I can remember, I've been deeply viscerally terrified by deep swimming pools. Just the thought of my legs dangling in cold, empty water sends a shiver up my spine, and one of my most persistent nightmares involves being sucked into a cavernous and yawning grate at the bottom of a pool.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This project was an attempt to face this fear and, quite literally, deconstruct it. Armed with a small waterproof video camera and years' worth of pent-up anxiety, I filmed myself jumping off the diving board and into the strange, silent, expansive underwater architecture of the pool:</p>

The process of drawing the frames was perhaps my favorite part of the project: it allowed me to sit quietly with imagery that would normally make me quite anxious, and instead find beauty in it.</p>
