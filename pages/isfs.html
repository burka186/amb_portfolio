			<h4>Medium: bubble wrap, tape, well-trafficked public space</h4>
			<br>
			<p>Instruction Set For Strangers is a group project in MFADT's Major Studio I that tasks students with designing an intervention into a public space in New York that would cause people to interact with the space differently, without using words. My group chose the Bethesda Terrace Underpass in Central Park, and decided that if we weren't allowed to use words, we would let bubble wrap speak for us instead...</p>

			<br>
			<p>Our first test used a 50’ long and 3’ wide ‘runway’ using regular bubble wrap. User interaction was moderate—kids, as predicted, loved it, and most adults were puzzled and cautious. We noticed an impulse by many adults to actively avoid the bubble wrap by jumping clear over it or walking all the way around the installation. The most unexpected interaction with our installation came when a group of picnickers set up shop on top of our bubble wrap. We thought it might have just been a coincidence since it was raining outside and the underpass was pretty full, but they revealed that they had actually positioned their group on top of/adjacent to the bubble wrap to provide a more comfortable place to sit for the members of their group who had not brought blankets or yoga mats.</p>
			<br>
			<p>We knew we were onto something with bubble wrap as a concept, but for our second iteration, we decided to dream a lot bigger. Literally. We purchased 300 feet of large-bubble bubble wrap and claimed a more central location in the underpass. Because we had noticed many adults exhibiting caution and avoidance around our initial test strip, we decided to add a further cue to engage in playful behavior by creating a giant piano keyboard out of poster board and tape, which we placed under the bubble wrap in the central walkway below the terrace.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Passersby were already intrigued at this stage, but we had a LOT of extra bubble wrap, and decided to further up the ante by stretching it all the way across the breadth of the walkway, such that it couldn’t be avoided. Because our initial test with the standard bubbles had made no appreciable sound, and because the popping sound of the large bubbles was not very significant with just the keyboard area in place, we were not at all prepared for what happened next…</p>
			<br>
			<p>Once we put the rest of the bubble wrap in place and people started walking—and dancing, and stomping, and running—across it, the popping sound became rather deafening. Within minutes, we were approached by several angry park-goers who complained about the disruptive noise.</p>

			<br>
			<p>Our intervention was certainly a success in terms of causing the inhabitants of the space to behave differently than they otherwise would have—either by engaging in playful behavior, as was our original intent; or by becoming angered by the loud noise generated by the installation—but we did not wish to cause a prolonged disturbance to the performers who were set up at the far end of the underpass tunnel, so we dismantled the installation after a (very well-trafficked) 10 minute test period.</p>
