			<h4>IDEAS IN DESIGN: Filip Locator and Phone</h4>
			<br>
			<p>Four years ago, Sten Kirkbak’s 3-year-old son, Filip, went missing at an Oslo shopping mall for 30 minutes. The incident inspired him to develop technology that would combine a cell phone, clock, and geo-locator all in the guise of a brightly-colored, kid-friendly wristwatch. To realize his idea, Kirkbak brough the project to Norwegian design duo Anderssen &#38; Voll, who sought to find a delicate balance between form and function. Says Torbjørn Anderssen: “The technology we needed didn’t exist when we started. We needed to find a form that would communicate the function of the product. The biggest challenge was packing all this technology down into something that would actually fit a child’s wrist.” The tech component—a combination of GPS, cell-tower technology, and Wi-Fi—was developed by a team of engineers in North Carolina who created three of the world’s smallest antennas to fit the device. “It’s been inspiring to see that our design thinking is a resource to the engineering team on subjects of complex technicality,” Anderssen says. “The easiest way to think outside the box is sometimes not knowing what the box looks like or where it is.”</p>
