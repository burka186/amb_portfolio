			<h4>IDEAS IN DESIGN: Swarovski Takes a Shining to Wallpaper</h4>
			<br>
			<p>In recent years, Swarovski crystals have put pizzazz in products large and small, from Edra furniture to iPod cases. No surprise, then, that Swarovski Elements’ debut foray into the wallpaper market also dazzles. The 11-piece collection, created by London-based designer Karen Beauchamp and released this September, takes inspiration from “a feeling of Venetian decadence,” she says. Despite roots in Old-World opulence, the aesthetic, rendered in velvet flocking and metallic ink, still feels decidedly modern. Applied to the paper individually or sprayed in a dense layer, crystals provide a near-psychedlic iridescence.</p>

			<h4>Substance Reuse: We’re Addicted to These Innovations That Rethink Practical Materials</h4>
			<br>
			<p><em>In this column, we ask Material Connexion vice president Andrew Dent, Ph.D., to select six innovations set to influence what designers will be using tomorrow.</em></p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>01</strong> Kapok Fiber by Jarupun Mattress Company offers a lighter and softer alternative to widely used cotton stuffing, which because of floods in cotton-growing Pakistan and Australia, no longer comes cheap. Cultivated in the rainforests of Southeast Asia and Central and South America, Kapok Fiber is harvested from the fluffy fiber-filled seedpods of the kapok tree and can be used to stuff anything from pillows to teddy bears.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>02</strong> Rubitherm Technologies has created a powerful new material called Rubitherm GR that holds within its pores a chemical that can change from solid to liquid in order absorb excessive heat or, in turn, to release heat when things cool down. This makes it useful for construction, clean air-conditioning, solar-energy storage, and for food and pharmaceutical transport, as well as high-tech textiles.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>03</strong> Vulcanization, the process of turning virgin rubber into stable, car-tire rubber, has never been an economically viable process&#8212;until now. Green Rubber, manufactured using a new process to de-vulcanize used material by breaking its chemical bonds, results in a virgin-like product. Instead of taking up space in landfills, more tires can be recycled</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>04</strong> To manufacture Inclusion, a paneling material available in both opaque and transparent versions, France-based Lamellux combines resin with hexagonal aluminum honeycomb. Variable optics can provide privacy, with the honeycomb obscuring vision when viewed at an angle and appearing transparent when viewed straight-on&#8212;ideal for doors and ceilings, plus retail, office, and hospitality spaces.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>05</strong> Although CTL-TH Packaging’s cost-efficient, highly recyclable Easy Supply Tube looks like an ordinary polypropylene container, it’s anything but. Developed in an in-mold labeling process, high-resolution images are applied via thin graphic films, thus eliminating traditional (and pricey) printing processes.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>06</strong> American Lime Technology’s Tradical Hemcrete, a non-combustible hemp and lime material, offers a green alternative to concrete building envelopes. In pre-cut blocks or poured, it’s as durable as cement. And carbon negative.</p>
			<br>

			<h4>INTERIORS: Fotografiska Museum</h4>
			<br>
			<p>Location: Stockholm, Sweden<br><br>Design: Guise<br><br>To create a shop and reception area for Stockholm’s Fotografiska Museum, a photography repository housed in a 1906 Art Nouveau industrial building designed by Swedish architect Ferdinand Boberg, Guise’s Jani Kristoffersen and Andreas Ferm were tasked with giving the spaces a distinct identity and, as Kristofferson puts it, “letting function drive formal language.” The outcome is a metaphorical design based on clustered Corian-and-polished-steel book modules. Their silvery mirror-like surfaces throw back distorted, out-of-focus reflections&#8212;as if one were looking through a fuzzy camera lens&#8212;while also effecting striking geometric forms, almost as if by accident, from the books on display.</p>
