			<h4>INTERIORS: Hotel Lone</h4>
			<br>
			<p>Location: Rovinj, Croatia<br><br>Design: 3LHD<br><br>When creating Hotel Lone on the Istrian Peninsula, Croatian firm 3LHD looked to the site’s natural and manmade surroundings on the Adriatic coast. The 248-room hotel’s Y-shaped structure, with its curving terraces and six-story, glass-ceilinged lobby, recalls the sleek forms of 1970s modern buildings that dot the landscape. Inside, mirrored surfaces heighten sweeping views by refracting slivers of the nearby forest and seaside. In the public spaces, neutral-colored seating and lamps by Patricia Urquiola, David Rowland, and Richard Shultz are amped up by punchy yellow tones. Integrated subtly into this serene environment are specially commissioned installations by mixed-media artist Silvio Vujicic, including a geometric sculpture floating in the lobby. Vujicic also created screen-printed panels in each bedroom, offering a nod to traditional art of the region—and in their minimalist purity, a calm oasis to nod off in.</p>
